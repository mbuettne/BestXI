# BestXI

Java based web application using Spring Boot with JPA and MySQL for data persistence. Front end is Server-side rendered using Thymeleaf and Bootstrap. This was my final project for graduation from the Software Guild's Java Bootcamp.
This web application is designed to give high school soccer coaches the ability to make data-driven decisions about their starting lineup. It allows coaches to track stats for their players and games, review stats over the course of a season, and also picks the statistically best starting lineup for them based on key data for each position group (goals and assists for forwards, for example).
