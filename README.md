Java based web application using Spring Boot with JPA and MySQL for data persistence. Front end is Server-side rendered using Thymeleaf and Bootstrap. This was my final project for graduation from the Software Guild's Java Bootcamp.
This web application is designed to give high school soccer coaches the ability to make data-driven decisions about their starting lineup. It allows coaches to track stats for their players and games, review stats over the course of a season, and also picks the statistically best starting lineup for them based on key data for each position group (goals and assists for forwards, for example).
You can create a new account and team, or if you would like to see a fully developed team, you can log in with the following credentials. Feel free to add, update, and delete any of your own information, however please do not delete any data already entered in as I will likely not be upkeeping the database.

Username: User 
Password: User

Contrary to how it sounds, it will log you into an admin account with full functionality. There are also regular user accounts that can view all the data, but cannot create, update, or delete any.
